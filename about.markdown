My name is Michael Pearce, I have just finished my PhD in Maths at the University of Warwick in the UK, in September 2019, I submitted my PhD thesis titled "<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Pics/thesis(1).pdf" target="_blank">Bayesian Optimisation with Mutli-Task Gaussian Processes</a>". My brilliant supervisor is/was [Juergen Branke][JB_website] in the Operational Research and Management Science group in the Warwick Business School.

In my PhD, I focussed on extentions of Gaussian process model based optimisation to applications beyond global optmisation such as Bayesian quadrature optimisation, common random numbers, contextual optimisation and a few others. 
I also spent some time working in Warwick Medical School on Bayesian-Frequentist methods for clinical trials, I was an intern at Google Deepmind combining graphical models and variational autoencoders and most recently at Uber AI focusing on large scale Bayesian optimisation and optimisation over combinatorial domains.
