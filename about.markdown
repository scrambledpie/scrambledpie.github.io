My name is Michael Pearce, I have just finished my PhD in Maths at the University of Warwick in the UK.
My brilliant supervisor is/was [Juergen Branke][JB_website] in Warwick Business School and
in Septembe<br>r 2019, I submitted my PhD thesis titled "Bayesian Optimisation with Mutli-Task Gaussian Processes".

My PhD is mostly on extentions of Gaussian process model based optimisation to applications beyond global optmisation. 
I also spent some time working in Warwick Medical School on Bayesian-Frequentist methods for clinical trials, I did an internship at Google Deepmind combining graphical models and variational autoencoders and most recently at Uber AI focusing on large scale Bayesian optimisation and optimisation over combinatorial domains.
